flavor_rom.44.desc:0 "Centuries after the fall of the West, the Empire still stands firm — battered but unbroken, its people bound together by the unshakable faith of the Orthodox Church. With threats pressing from all sides, from astray Christian denominations and Germanic powers in the West to rising Zoroastrian forces in the East, the spirit of defense has become second nature to the Romans. Many within the Senate and the clergy proclaim that to preserve the faith is to guard the walls, that every bastion of stone is a pillar of Christianity."
