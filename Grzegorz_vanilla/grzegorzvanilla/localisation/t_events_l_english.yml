The ritual began with the priest desecrating, killing and placing in cruciform positions the virgins at these four joints, placing four purple stones into their mouths, 3 more stones are placed into the mouths of the virgins in perpendicular circles. Then each circle is lit and the virgins untouched by the fire sing the appropriate incantations. Suddenly, the Gateway to Agartha opens at our command, and one rider comes out, the one who united the Mongol peoples, the one rider who conquered the world.

If the fire's the same every day, it may as well burn out and nothing would change. But a wise man knows, that as the sacred fires burn on, history is written around them. Generations come into life around the Fire, and leave for the heavens around the Fire. Wars are fought, soldiers die, cities rise to prominence and fall into obscurity. But the Fire burns. As long as the fires are lit, the legacy of Grzegorz cannot die. A foolish man will see only light and heat in the fire. But a wise man will see eternity."
